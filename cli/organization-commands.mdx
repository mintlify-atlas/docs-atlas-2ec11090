description: Complete reference for Daytona organization management commands
---

## Overview

Organization commands allow you to create and manage organizations, which are the top-level containers for sandboxes, snapshots, and volumes in Daytona. Organizations provide resource isolation and team collaboration capabilities.

## daytona organization create

Create a new organization and set it as the active organization.

### Usage

```bash
daytona organization create [ORGANIZATION_NAME]
```

### Examples

```bash
# Create a new organization
daytona organization create my-team

# Create an organization with a descriptive name
daytona organization create acme-engineering
```

### Output

Displays organization details and a pending approval message:

```
[organization details]
Your organization has been created and its approval is pending
Our team has been notified and will set up your resource quotas shortly
```

### Notes

- The newly created organization is automatically set as your active organization
- New organizations require approval before full access is granted
- Resource quotas are configured by the Daytona team during the approval process

---

## daytona organization list

List all organizations you have access to.

### Usage

```bash
daytona organization list [flags]
```

### Flags

- `--format` - Output format (json, yaml)

### Examples

```bash
# List all organizations
daytona organization list

# Get organizations as JSON
daytona organization list --format json

# Get organizations as YAML
daytona organization list --format yaml
```

### Output

Displays a table with:
- Organization ID
- Organization name
- Active status (indicates which organization is currently active)
- Created date
- Status (Active, Pending, etc.)

```
ID                                    NAME                 ACTIVE    STATUS
7f8a9c2d-3e1f-4b6a-9c0d-5e8f7a2b3c4d  Personal            *         Active
8g9b0d3e-4f2g-5c7b-0d1e-6f9g8b3c4d5e  acme-engineering              Active
```

## daytona organization use

Switch to a different organization as your active organization.

### Usage

```bash
daytona organization use [ORGANIZATION] [flags]
```

### Arguments

- `[ORGANIZATION]` - Organization ID or name (optional - if not provided, an interactive prompt will be shown)

### Examples

```bash
# Switch to an organization by name
daytona organization use acme-engineering

# Switch to an organization by ID
daytona organization use 7f8a9c2d-3e1f-4b6a-9c0d-5e8f7a2b3c4d

# Interactive selection (no argument)
daytona organization use
```

### Output

```
Organization acme-engineering is now active
```

### Notes

- The active organization determines which resources (sandboxes, snapshots, volumes) you see and interact with
- All subsequent commands will use the active organization's context
- You can switch between organizations at any time

---

## daytona organization delete

Delete an organization.

### Usage

```bash
daytona organization delete [ORGANIZATION] [flags]
```

### Arguments

- `[ORGANIZATION]` - Organization ID or name (optional - if not provided, an interactive prompt will be shown)

### Examples

```bash
# Delete an organization by name
daytona organization delete old-team

# Delete an organization by ID
daytona organization delete 7f8a9c2d-3e1f-4b6a-9c0d-5e8f7a2b3c4d

# Interactive selection (no argument)
daytona organization delete
```

### Output

```
Organization old-team has been deleted
```

### Notes

- You cannot delete your Personal organization
- If you delete the currently active organization, the system automatically switches to your Personal organization
- All resources (sandboxes, snapshots, volumes) in the organization will be deleted
- This action is irreversible

---

## Understanding Organizations

### Personal Organization

Every user has a default "Personal" organization:

- Created automatically when you first log in
- Cannot be deleted
- Used as the fallback when other organizations are deleted
- Ideal for personal projects and experimentation

### Team Organizations

Additional organizations can be created for:

- Team collaboration
- Project isolation
- Resource management
- Different environments (dev, staging, production)

---

## Common Patterns

### Create Organization for a Team

```bash
# Create the organization
daytona organization create acme-backend-team

# Wait for approval
# Once approved, create resources
daytona create --snapshot ubuntu --name team-dev-env
```

### Switch Between Personal and Team Work

```bash
# Work on personal projects
daytona organization use Personal
daytona create --snapshot ubuntu --name my-experiment

# Switch to team organization
daytona organization use acme-engineering
daytona create --snapshot node --name team-api-server

# List only team sandboxes
daytona list
```

### Manage Multiple Projects

```bash
# Create organizations for different projects
daytona organization create project-alpha
daytona organization create project-beta

# Work on project alpha
daytona organization use project-alpha
daytona create --snapshot python --name alpha-backend
daytona volume create alpha-data

# Switch to project beta
daytona organization use project-beta
daytona create --snapshot node --name beta-frontend
daytona volume create beta-data

# List all organizations
daytona organization list
```

### Clean Up Old Organization

```bash
# List organizations
daytona organization list

# Switch away from the organization to delete
daytona organization use Personal

# Delete the old organization
daytona organization delete old-project
```

### Scripted Organization Management

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Get current active organization
CURRENT_ORG=$(daytona organization list --format json | jq -r '.[] | select(.active) | .name')
echo "Current organization: $CURRENT_ORG"

# Switch to different organization
daytona organization use production-team

# Do work...
daytona create --snapshot ubuntu --name prod-sandbox

# Switch back
daytona organization use "$CURRENT_ORG"
```

---

## Organization Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

Use clear, descriptive names:

```bash
# Good names
daytona organization create acme-backend-team
daytona organization create project-phoenix-dev
daytona organization create client-xyz-production

# Avoid generic names
# daytona organization create test
# daytona organization create org1
```

### Resource Organization

Group related resources in the same organization:

```bash
# Create organization for a project
daytona organization create ecommerce-platform

# Use it for all project resources
daytona organization use ecommerce-platform

# Create related resources
daytona volume create postgres-data
daytona snapshot create custom-backend
daytona create --snapshot custom-backend --name api-server
daytona create --snapshot postgres --name database
```

### Environment Separation

Use different organizations for different environments:

```bash
# Development environment
daytona organization create myapp-development
daytona organization use myapp-development
daytona create --snapshot node --name dev-api

# Staging environment
daytona organization create myapp-staging
daytona organization use myapp-staging
daytona create --snapshot node --name staging-api

# Production environment
daytona organization create myapp-production
daytona organization use myapp-production
daytona create --snapshot node --name prod-api
```

### Check Active Organization

Always verify which organization you're working in:

```bash
# Before creating resources
daytona organization list

# Or check with format flag
daytona organization list --format json | jq -r '.[] | select(.active)'
```

### Interactive Selection

When unsure, use interactive mode:

```bash
# Interactive organization selection
daytona organization use

# Interactive organization deletion
daytona organization delete
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Organization Approval Pending

If your organization is pending approval:

1. Wait for the Daytona team to review and approve
2. Check your email for approval notifications
3. Contact support if approval takes longer than expected

### Cannot Delete Personal Organization

The Personal organization is protected:

```bash
# This will fail
daytona organization delete Personal

# Error: cannot delete personal organization
```

You can always use your Personal organization, but cannot delete it.

### Lost Active Organization Context

If you're unsure which organization is active:

```bash
# Check active organization
daytona organization list

# The active organization will have an asterisk (*) or be marked as ACTIVE
```

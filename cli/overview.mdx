## Introduction

The Daytona CLI is a command-line interface for managing Daytona Sandboxes. It provides a complete set of tools to create, manage, and interact with sandboxes, snapshots, volumes, and organizations.

## Installation

To install the Daytona CLI, follow the instructions in the [Installation Guide](/installation).

## Getting Started

After installation, authenticate with your Daytona account:

```bash
daytona login
```

This will open your browser to complete the authentication process.

## Basic Usage

The Daytona CLI follows a standard command structure:

```bash
daytona [command] [subcommand] [flags]
```

### Quick Start

Create your first sandbox:

```bash
# Create a sandbox from a snapshot
daytona create --snapshot ubuntu

# List all sandboxes
daytona list

# SSH into a sandbox
daytona ssh my-sandbox
```

## Command Categories

The CLI is organized into the following command groups:

### Sandbox Commands

Manage sandboxes - create, list, start, stop, delete, and interact with your development environments.

```bash
daytona create      # Create a new sandbox
daytona list        # List all sandboxes
daytona start       # Start a sandbox
daytona stop        # Stop a sandbox

daytona ssh         # SSH into a sandbox
daytona exec        # Execute commands in a sandbox

### Snapshot Commands

Manage sandbox snapshots - create, list, and push custom images.

```bash
daytona snapshot create   # Create a snapshot

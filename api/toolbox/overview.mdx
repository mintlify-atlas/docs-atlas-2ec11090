title: Toolbox API Overview
description: Internal API for sandbox operations in Daytona
---

The Toolbox API is an HTTP REST API that runs inside Daytona sandboxes, providing programmatic access to sandbox operations including process execution, file system management, Git operations, and LSP functionality.

## What is the Toolbox API?

The Toolbox API is an internal service that:

- Runs automatically inside every Daytona sandbox
- Provides RESTful endpoints for sandbox operations
- Enables automation and integration with development tools
- Powers the Daytona SDKs (TypeScript, Python, Ruby, Go)

## How It Works

When a Daytona sandbox starts, the Toolbox API server automatically launches and listens on a local port. The API provides authenticated access to sandbox resources through HTTP endpoints organized by functionality:

- **Process** - Execute commands, manage PTY sessions, and shell sessions
- **File System** - Read, write, search, and manage files and directories
- **Git** - Clone repositories, manage branches, commit, push, and pull changes
- **LSP** - Language Server Protocol integration for code intelligence
- **Port** - Manage and query network ports
- **Computer Use** - GUI automation capabilities (keyboard, mouse, screenshots)

## Authentication

The Toolbox API requires authentication via bearer token:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

The token is automatically configured when using the official Daytona SDKs.

## For Internal Use via SDKs

<Warning>
The Toolbox API is designed for **internal use** through the official Daytona SDKs. Direct API calls are not recommended for production use.
</Warning>

Instead of calling the Toolbox API directly, use the appropriate SDK:

- **TypeScript/JavaScript**: `@daytona/sdk`
- **Python**: `daytona-sdk`
- **Ruby**: `daytona-sdk`
- **Go**: `github.com/daytonaio/daytona/pkg/sdk`

These SDKs provide:
- Type-safe interfaces
- Error handling
- Automatic authentication
- Connection management
- Higher-level abstractions

## Base URL

The Toolbox API runs on `http://localhost:<port>` inside the sandbox. The port is dynamically assigned and available through the SDK configuration.

## API Organization

The API endpoints are organized into logical groups:

| Group | Endpoints | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Process | `/process/*` | Command execution, PTY, and sessions |
| File System | `/files/*` | File and directory operations |
| Git | `/git/*` | Version control operations |
| LSP | `/lsp/*` | Language server integration |
| Port | `/port/*` | Port management |
| Computer Use | `/computeruse/*` | GUI automation |
| Info | `/version`, `/work-dir`, `/user-home-dir` | System information |
| Server | `/init` | Server initialization |

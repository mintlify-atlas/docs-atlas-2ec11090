## Notes

- This operation is irreversible and will permanently delete the sandbox
- All data stored in the sandbox will be lost unless backed up
- Attached volumes are not automatically deleted and must be managed separately
- The sandbox state will transition to `destroying` and eventually to `destroyed`

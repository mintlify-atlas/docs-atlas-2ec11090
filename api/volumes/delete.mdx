curl -X DELETE https://api.daytona.io/volumes/vol_abc123xyz \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"

## Before deleting

Make sure to unmount the volume from all sandboxes before deletion:

1. List all sandboxes using the volume
2. Stop or delete those sandboxes
3. Then delete the volume

## Alternative: Get volume ID by name

If you only have the volume name, first get the volume details to find its ID:

```bash
# Get volume by name
curl https://api.daytona.io/volumes/by-name/my-data-volume \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"

# Response includes ID: "vol_abc123xyz"

# Delete by ID
curl -X DELETE https://api.daytona.io/volumes/vol_abc123xyz \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## SDK Languages

All examples are available in:
- **Python** - Full async/sync support
- **TypeScript** - Promise-based async API
- **Go** - Context-based operations

## Getting Started

Before running these examples, make sure you have:

1. Installed the Daytona SDK for your language
2. Set your `DAYTONA_API_KEY` environment variable
3. Configured your Daytona API endpoint (if using self-hosted)

<CodeGroup>
```bash Python
pip install daytona-sdk
export DAYTONA_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

```bash TypeScript
npm install @daytonaio/sdk
export DAYTONA_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

```bash Go
go get github.com/daytonaio/daytona/libs/sdk-go
export DAYTONA_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```
</CodeGroup>

## Example Structure

Each example page includes:
- Complete, working code for all three SDKs
- Detailed explanations of key concepts
- Expected output from running the examples
- Best practices and tips

## Running the Examples

All examples are standalone and can be run directly. Simply copy the code for your preferred language and run it.

<Note>
The examples use the default Daytona endpoint. If you're using a self-hosted instance, configure the endpoint in your client initialization.
